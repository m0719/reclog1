## Geoserver
Downloaded on 26 sept 2019 from http://geoserver.org/release/stable/ as "War Archive". This file is a zip.
Unpacking the zip reveals a .war file. As the .war file is over 100MiB, github will not accept it due to file size. 

To circumvent this issue, unpack the .war file with any packager (like 7zip). Then pack the resulted files/directories again with the highest possible compression. In case of version 2.15.2 the filesize went from 101 MiB zip to 89 MiB 7zip.
